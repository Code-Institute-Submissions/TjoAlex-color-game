                        <h3>What RGB is</h3>
                        <p>It is most likely that if youve designed for a web application or worked on a
                            coloring app
                            you have stumled across RGB. Whilst many of us know that when someone want to
                            designing anything, color
                            becomes a crusial part and you will in this case need to identify which color module
                            you would
                            prefere to use. A lot depending on what application you are using the color/colors
                            for.</p>
                        <p>RGB are used primarily for computer screen applications and also know for
                            being one of the most
                            commonly used color modules. It consists of Red, Green and blue hues that can create
                            a large amout
                            of different colors when combined. You can think of it as someone mixing two acrylic
                            colors on a color palet
                            let's say blue and red, that will make a deep purple color same goes for RGB when
                            the three of it's
                            values are implemented it will mix those colors and create your prefered color. </p>

                        <br>
                        <h3>How RGB works</h3>
                        <p>RGB is short for the colors Red, Green and Blue,
                            It is used by numbers as rgb(0,0,255) that in this case gives us the color blue,
                            this
                            because the
                            values shown defines the intensity of each color. So if I instead want the color
                            green I must
                            change the value to rgb(0,255,0) and the color will become green.
                            These numbers that define the intensity of the colors stay between 0 that is the
                            lowest and 255
                            that is the highest value. And that's why when you then rember the order of the
                            RGB
                            name
                            (red,green
                            and blue) it becomes more easy to guess what color the value provide.</p>
                        <p>How do we mean by that? Well if the value is high of red and high of blue but low
                            of
                            green, it
                            most likely are so that the color is drawn towards a more purple color.
                            With that in mind, you can more easily find a simple understanding of how RGB
                            works
                            and I would
                            higly advice you to go and play the game to already test your skills. But before
                            that make sure

                                <p>On the image beside or under this text depending on what device you have, it shows
                                    how the rgb looks and have some numbers added to different sections each nuber is
                                    explained in the list of all the features the game have to offer and in return helsp
                                    one to understand how it works. Have a look:</p>
                                <p> 1: A random RGB value is shown under the game name, it is this value you will
                                    pick
                                    the right
                                    color for.
                                </p>
                                <p> 2: Some of the colored squares is the correct color for the RGB value shown
                                    in step 1. Klick on them to choose the right one and you will either get
                                    correct
                                    or try again.
                                </p>
                                <p> 3: Under the RGB value you will get a message after pressing one of the
                                    squares,
                                    this will
                                    tell you if the answer was correct or not.
                                </p>
                                <p> 4: Here is a button that gives you the option to get a new RGB value if the
                                    first
                                    one was too hard
                                    this button then changes the RGB value when you press it as well as changing
                                    all
                                    the colors of the squares. Lastly if you guess correct this button will
                                    change
                                    to try again
                                    that after being clicked will give a new random RGB value and colored
                                    squares.
                                </p>
