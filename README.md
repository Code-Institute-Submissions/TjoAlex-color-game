## UX 

## Strategy
Welcome to RGB Color Game where we want to give the user a fun and easy way of learning RGB. It begins with the user getting all information needed to learn everything about RGB and then suggest that the user start playing a game to exercise on what one just learned. This game provides squares that holds different colors and a rgb value the user then should look to and try to guess what color it have by clicking on the square holding the correct color. The user also have the option to reset the current rgb in case the first one was too hard to figure out. After that there is just to play along with the game, go back to the home page holding all information if needed and make the most use out of the site, to make sure the websites main purpouse continues to help someone learn rgb.

# The realisation of this project

* Website 1: I started off this project based on this website <a href="https://jsndesign.co.uk/blog/javascript-rgb-hex-color-game/">jsndesign</a> that helped me gain understanding of how the structure of the code could be done. I followed it’s guide to grasp how to make a game like this work and started coding on my own with this websites information in the back of my head. After getting stuck with features as to randomize a value I had to turn to google to find more understanding leading me to Video 2. 

* Video 2: From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-RUryVGA8&t=21s">FaithTower MediaTeck</a> on youtube I found another version of a game reminding me of the one I liked to create, and as discussed in the previous section I could here start to get the grasp of a solution for how to create a function randomizing rgb values by using a random integer such as math random. Yet to further understand the structure I also turned to website 3. 

* Website 3: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">W3School</a> was the main website used trough out this project, it gave me further understanding of functions and implementations that could work with my code without needing to copy and paste someone else code, mostly so regarding what was mentioned above and also regarding how to implement a easy and hard function as well ass understanding some extra css. 

* Website 4: <a href="https://mdbootstrap.com/">MDB</a> bootstrap was used so that I would understand core concepts of bootstrap and learn simple ways to work with the boostrap library in a more simple way and create more out of the look I wanted for the website. 

My own feature: Not only is the styling a big part here as well as the information page holding how the game works and explaining rgb something impelented by me. But my main purpose by choosing this game was to find a good way to make this code my own and in a more functional way that makes it easy for several people to read and understand what was going in. 


# Testing 

The W3C Markup Validator, W3C CSS Validator and jshint.com was used to validate every page of the website to make sure there was no syntax errors in the project. 

<a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validator</a> - Two errors found for the index.html page telling me to remove stray end div tags, after fixing that no errors or warnings was found. 

<a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator">W3C CSS Validator</a> - No errors or warnings found.

<a href="https://www.jslint.com/">Jslint.com</a> - No errors or warnings found.

## Further Testing 

* The website was tested on google chrome and Safari browsers. 
* The website was viewed on various different devices, laptops, different iPhones and desktops.
* The website was viewed on google chrome dev tools to find any errors and test overall responsiveness.
* Friends, family, slack members and my mentor had the chance to look at this website and give me some extra feedback on potential issues, bugs and user experience issues. 

## Known bugs

* The squares once they are clicked turn black when clicking on them and the answer is wrong, my wish was to make these go white so that they ”disappear” yet this maintain for a future fix. 
* On mobile devices the squares goes a bit too small and could be hard to see for some people. 
* The Javascript code in a best case scenario need some refactoring to get more clean.
